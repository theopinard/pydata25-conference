# Communication

Effective communication is key to ensuring that all the necessary information reaches our community and attendees. The
Office team works closely with the Communications Committee to ensure that important updates about finances,
sponsorships, ticketing, and other logistics are shared promptly and accurately.

- Maintain open and collaborative communication with the Communications Committee regarding deadlines and required
  announcements.
- Ensure timely updates are provided to the Communications Committee, allowing them to craft appropriate messaging for
  the community.
- Address any communication needs or requests from the Communications Committee in a constructive and supportive manner,
  ensuring both teams are aligned on shared goals.
