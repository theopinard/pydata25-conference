# General Considerations

We would like to provide the following instructions in the CfP to clarify what we are looking for in the conference.

Content related:

- topics of interest
- submission types (30-minute talks, 3-hour workshop, etc.)
- levels of expertise (beginner, intermediate, advanced)

Non-content related:

- perks for accepted speakers (free ticket, etc.)
- perks not to expected (no travel reimbursement, etc.) - _other conferences might offer this_
- mentoring offers for first-time speakers
- diversity and inclusion efforts (grants, etc.)
- inclusion (e.g., childcare, accessibility)

## :fontawesome-solid-gavel: Policies

We discussed policies in the team before launching the CfP.
It's useful to have consistent policies settled beforehand, and we want to communicate them clearly to the submitters.

### Presentations Weighting

Based on participant stats and feedback, we are looking for a mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced topics.

| Level        | Description                                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| beginner     | New to the topic, basic understanding, needs step-by-step guidance      |
| intermediate | Regular user, familiar with common concepts, can solve typical problems |
| advanced     | Extensive experience, deep understanding, can handle complex scenarios  |

In 2024, the participants self-assessed as follows:

=== "Cross-Functional Knowledge"

    | Python            |   Python |              |          |         |

| beginner     | 20%        | 
| intermediate | 45%        |
| advanced     | 35%        |

### Community Topics

Based on participant feedback, we want to make sure community topics are well represented and
we will work towards it with designated groups.

### Beginners

We want to work on dedicated formats for beginners
that offer a suitable environment for them to present and learn.

### Intermediate & Advanced Topics

We would like to ask the speakers of intermediate and advanced topics to:

- outline prerequisites for attending their presentation
- focus the presentation on the main topic, excluding introductory material

### First-Time Speakers

We want to encourage first-time speakers to submit their proposals.
We offer mentorship opportunities and will work with first time speakers to improve your submission if necessary.

### One Presentation per Speaker

We are interested in hearing from many voices. In the CfP, we accept one presentation per speaker only.

### Non-acceptance

We **do not accept** presentations that:

- can only be delivered remotely
- are part of a sales pitch

We likely **do not accept** presentations that:

- are available on video already or will be soon. Fresh content is preferred.

## :fontawesome-solid-handshake: Trust

We trust speakers to provide accurate information about their presentation.
Submitting misleading or false information undermines our trust in the submission. :fontawesome-solid-handshake-slash:

## Call for Proposals: {{config.extra.event.event_name}}

Our 2025 conference will take place in Darmstadt (close to Frankfurt), as a joint effort between PyCon DE and PyData
offering dedicated tracks for diverse interests, with both on-site and remote access for attendees. Please note, while
attendees can choose their mode of participation, presenters **must** deliver their sessions on-site.

Please go to our [Pretalx website](https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2025/cfp) to submit your proposals. You will need
to set up an account there (it can be deleted by you anytime), and you can edit your proposals until the Call for
Proposals closes.

Please feel free to forward this call to anyone you think might be interested in submitting a proposal.

**PyConDE** brings together developers, DevOps, scientists, and individuals from the Python community to discuss
application techniques, updates to the language, further Open Source development, and the community. Our talks often
include new features of the Python language, new libraries, security, testing, web, and programming & software
engineering in general.

**PyData** brings together analysts, scientists, developers, engineers, researchers, enthusiasts and individuals from
the AI & Data Science community to discuss applications of new tools and techniques. Our talks often include data
management, analytics, visualisation as well as new machine learning, statistical, and deep learning approaches.

#### **Conference Tracks & Topics of Interest**

The conference will feature three main tracks.

1. PyData
2. PyCon
3. General

Tutorials can be given in each of the tracks above. In order to simplify the review process and the creation of the

at [PyData](https://www.youtube.com/user/PyDataTV/), [PyConDE](https://www.youtube.com/pyconde).

#### **Presentation Format**

Presentation content can be at a novice, intermediate or advanced level. Talks will have two possible lengths, either 30
or 45 minutes, and hands-on tutorials will last 90 minutes. While attendees can participate remotely, we require all
speakers to deliver their presentations in person at the conference venue. We encourage submissions aimed at a highly
python-proficient target audience, following the insights from last year's attendee self-evaluation:

* Beginner 20%
* Intermediate 45%
* Advanced 35%

Accepted submissions will receive one free ticket. Travel expenses will not be covered; however, we offer a support
program aid and strongly encourage speakers, who may face financial barriers, to apply for travel funding when
submitting your proposal.

#### **Submission Process**

Please go to our [Pretalx website](https://pretalx.com/pyconde-pydata-2025/cfp) to submit your proposals through the
webform. After the submission deadline, proposals will be peer-reviewed and later selected by the program committee.

#### **Your Submission**

In our experience, attendees pay close attention to proposal abstracts when deciding which talks to attend during the
conference. The submitted abstract will be published as is in the conference program (you can edit the submission
later).

We encourage contributors to submit content that is original and has not been previously presented or recycled from
other events. We are committed to offering our attendees a program filled with fresh and engaging perspectives. To
achieve this, we seek submissions that bring innovative ideas, practical insights, and unique experiences to our
audience. We kindly ask potential presenters to refrain from submitting material that has already been shared at other
conferences or events, ensuring that our conference remains a platform for new and valuable content. Submissions that do
not adhere to this guideline will be automatically rejected.

In your submission, please include details about the theory, concepts and/or practice you will discuss. Specifically, if
the system you've built uses open source tools, please mention the libraries in the proposal and make it clear whether
you will be presenting a case-study of their use or if you will discuss details of their design.

In general, conference attendees, as well as the review committee, should be able to answer these questions based on
your submission:

* What problem is your talk addressing (are you talking about a well-known problem, or have you found something new
  during a project)?
* Why is the problem relevant to the audience?
* What is (are) your solution(s) to the problem?
* What are the main takeaways from your talk? For a tutorial submission, this is extremely important, please specify
  what people will have learned at the end of the tutorial session.

We recommend including an outline of your talk to help the audience assess the content and structure of your submission.

As a reminder, PyConDE and PyData presentations are intended to share knowledge and experience. To this end, we
encourage the code and/or data that your talk relies on to be open-source. Ideally, the audience would have access to
the necessary tools to reproduce the results of the talk. Also, we welcome talks focused on your own practical
application of tools and concepts either at work or in your free time, but discourage sales-oriented proposals whose
sole aim is to sell a product.

#### **Important Dates**

Talk Proposal Deadline:   22nd December 2024 23:59:59 CET   
Acceptance Notification:   5th February 2025   
Conference Dates:    23 \- 25th April 2025

#### **Childcare**

During conference hours, there will be childcare offered for free.

#### **First-Time Speakers**

We especially encourage first-time speakers and submissions by underrepresented members of the community.

#### **Travel Sponsorship**

As a volunteer-run and non-profit supported conference, we cannot offer travel sponsorship for all speakers. However, as
part of our diversity program, we do have a limited number of travel scholarships for attendees and speakers. You can
learn more about the scholarship on our Diversity Program page, where you can submit an application.

#### **Code of Conduct**

We strive to maintain the Python community’s reputation for being welcoming, friendly, and supportive. To this end, we
ask all attendees, organisers and sponsors to follow
the [Code of Conduct](https://theopinard.github.io/pydata25-conference/code-of-conduct/).
