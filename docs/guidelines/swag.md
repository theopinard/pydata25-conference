## Swag Guidelines

We do not produce any swag except for the pre-order conference t-shirts.

## Attendee Swag

T-Shirts are available for pre-order only and included in the ticket price.

## Volunteer Swag

Volunteers and Organizers receive a free t-shirt, sweater or hoodie. 
For visibility, these items are in a different color than the attendee t-shirts.
